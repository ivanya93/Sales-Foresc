# Project Brief: Spreadsheet Analysis / Data Analysis
# In this project you'll use Python to do very basic data analysis on a spreadsheet. The standard
# project will use csv file that contains fake sales data. After completing the required tasks you are
# free to change the csv file that you use.
# The csv file for the standard project is called sales.csv and is included with your course materials.

#  1. Read the data from the spreadsheet

# import csv and math libraries
