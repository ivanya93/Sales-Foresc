Project Title: Sales Forescasting - Data Analysis

Project Overview

This project is the capstone for the “Introduction to Python and Apps” course by Code First Girls. The objective is to perform basic data analysis on a sales dataset using Python. 
The dataset used is a CSV file containing fake sales data, named sales.csv. This project demonstrates the use of Python for reading data, performing calculations, and generating insights through various analyses.

Project Files

	•	sales.csv: The dataset containing sales data.
	•	main.py: The Python script that performs the data analysis.
	•	Monthly_changes.csv: Output file containing the monthly changes in sales as a percentage.
	•	Average_Sale.csv: Output file containing the average annual sales.
	•	Highest_Sale.csv: Output file containing the month with the highest sales.
	•	Lowest_Sale.csv: Output file containing the month with the lowest sales.

Prerequisites

	•	Python 3.x
	•	CSV file named sales.csv in the same directory as the script
	•	Libraries: csv, math, pandas, matplotlib

Installation

	1.	Clone the repository or download the main.py file.
	2.	Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
	3.	Install the required libraries if not already installed:
 
 pip install pandas matplotlib

 4.	Place the sales.csv file in the same directory as the main.py script.

Usage

	1.	Run the main.py script using Python:
python main.py

Script Breakdown

	1.	Reading the Data from the Spreadsheet:
	•	Uses csv to read the sales.csv file and print its contents.
	2.	Collecting Sales Data:
	•	Collects all sales from each month into a single list.
	3.	Calculating Total Sales:
	•	Outputs the total sales across all months.
	4.	Calculating Total Annual Expenditure:
	•	Outputs the total annual expenditure.
	5.	Calculating Monthly Changes in Sales:
	•	Computes monthly changes in sales as a percentage and exports the results to Monthly_changes.csv.
	6.	Calculating Average Annual Sales:
	•	Computes the average annual sales and exports the result to Average_Sale.csv.
	7.	Identifying Month with Highest Sales:
	•	Determines the month with the highest sales and exports the result to Highest_Sale.csv.
	8.	Identifying Month with Lowest Sales:
	•	Determines the month with the lowest sales and exports the result to Lowest_Sale.csv.
	9.	Calculating Average Expenditure:
	•	Computes the average annual expenditure.
	10.	Identifying Month with Highest Expenditure:
	•	Determines the month with the highest expenditure.
	11.	Identifying Month with Lowest Expenditure:
	•	Determines the month with the lowest expenditure.
	12.	Visualizations:
	•	Uses pandas and matplotlib to visualize the correlation between sales and expenditures over the months.

Example Outputs

	•	Monthly Changes:
	•	A CSV file named Monthly_changes.csv containing the monthly changes in sales as a percentage.
	•	Average Annual Sale:
	•	A CSV file named Average_Sale.csv containing the average annual sale.
	•	Month with Highest Sale:
	•	A CSV file named Highest_Sale.csv containing the month with the highest sales.
	•	Month with Lowest Sale:
	•	A CSV file named Lowest_Sale.csv containing the month with the lowest sales.
	•	Visualizations:
	•	A chart showing the variations in sales and expenditures over the months.

Conclusion

This project showcases basic data analysis using Python, handling CSV files, performing calculations, and generating visualizations. 
It provides valuable insights into sales and expenditures, demonstrating practical applications of Python in data analysis.
